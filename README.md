## 🎯 Project Goal

The main goal of this project was to create a visually appealing and technically rich **3D space simulation** rendered on the web, while exploring the integration of **Three.js** with the **Vue.js Composition API** and **TypeScript**. This project served as a frontend-focused academic demonstration of applied **computer graphics**.

---

## ✅ Problem Solved / Technical Objective

Develop a fully interactive 3D scene on the web by:

- Integrating WebGL graphics (Three.js) into the Vue lifecycle
- Managing reactivity and performance in a modern frontend framework
- Structuring scalable and type-safe code using TypeScript
- Providing a dynamic, animated space environment with proper depth, lighting and camera controls

## 🔧 Technical Stack & Highlights

| Technology              | Role / Purpose                                                                 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Vue 3 (Composition API)** | Component-based UI with reactive logic and separation of concerns         |
| **TypeScript**           | Static typing for 3D object control, vector math and component safety        |
| **Three.js**             | Core engine for rendering planets, lighting, 3D depth and orbital animation |
| **Vite**                 | Fast build tool and development server                                       |

### 🔍 Key Features

- ✅ Scene setup: Camera, light, objects, and renderer encapsulated in lifecycle-safe logic
- ♻️ Reusable composables: Clean division between graphics logic and UI structure
- 🌍 Simulated solar system: Rotating planets and stars in a 3D canvas
- 🌀 Real-time animation: Custom animation loop using `requestAnimationFrame`
- 📱 Responsive canvas: Dynamic resizing and adaptability across all screen sizes
- ⚙️ Performance optimized: Smooth rendering on mid-range devices

---

## 🧠 Challenge Overcome

**Integrating Three.js inside a Vue SPA using the Composition API and TypeScript** — a complex task due to the manual nature of WebGL and DOM management, requiring deep understanding of:

- Reactivity vs. imperative rendering
- Lifecycle coordination for 3D rendering
- Frame updates with `requestAnimationFrame`
- Perspective, lighting, and depth handling

---

## 📈 Outcomes

- 🎓 Delivered a high-impact academic presentation with a compelling 3D visual experience
- 💡 Demonstrated ability to combine low-level rendering (Three.js) with modern frontend tools
- 🔧 Validated skills in advanced TypeScript, component design and WebGL fundamentals
- 🌟 Created a fully deployable and scalable 3D frontend visualization
